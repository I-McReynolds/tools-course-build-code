# Sample code for the build automation lessons

Developed for the course "Introduction to Tools of the Trade" <https://uva-cs.github.io/cs1501-tools/readme.html> offered in Fall 2020 for students at the University of Virginia and the University of Virginia at Wise.

The YouTube channel for this course can be found here <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9qkQ1s5iWY6PzYZ5BiD-tQ>. The videos that go with these files are the Week 5 videos.   See Week 5 in the Weekly Activities section of the course website above for more info.

When you download this repo, you'll get a subdirectory for each of the three language/tool pairs covered in this lesson:

* CMake for C++ 
* Pip and Virtualenv for Python
* Gradle for Java

Each subdirectory has a README but these essentially are notes to help the course staff as we developed and debugged the demos.  Those notes were not written for an audience of students in the course, but they'e been left there in case they're useful.
